A smaller margin of error indicates a more precise estimate, while a larger margin of error suggests greater uncertainty.\n",

Larger sample sizes provide more information about the population, making the estimate more precise.\n",

If you survey 100 people and find that 60% of them support the candidate, your margin of error might be relatively large. However, if you increase the sample size to 1,000 people and find that 58% support the candidate, your margin of error will be smaller for the larger sample size.
