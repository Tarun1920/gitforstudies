    "Gradient Boosting Regression, often referred to as Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) or simply Gradient Boosting, is a machine learning technique used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and robust regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Gradient Boosting Regression works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees: The fundamental building blocks of Gradient Boosting are decision trees, which are used to make predictions. Each tree is a simple model that takes input features and produces an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Training: The algorithm starts with a single decision tree and makes predictions. Then, it calculates the errors or residuals between the actual target values and the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting: In the next step, a new decision tree is trained to predict these errors instead of the original target values. This new tree focuses on the mistakes made by the previous model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble: The predictions of this new tree are combined with the previous model's predictions to improve the overall prediction. This process is repeated iteratively, where each new tree is trained to predict the errors of the combined model. The idea is to gradually reduce the errors in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent: The term \"Gradient\" in Gradient Boosting refers to the use of gradient descent optimization to minimize the errors in each step. It adjusts the parameters of each tree in the direction that minimizes the loss function, making the model gradually better at predicting the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criterion: The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a predefined number of trees or when the model's performance plateaus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regression has become a popular choice for regression tasks because it is highly effective and can handle a wide range of data types and complexities. It often outperforms individual decision trees and many other regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common libraries that provide implementations of Gradient Boosting Regression include XGBoost, LightGBM, and scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor. These libraries allow you to fine-tune the hyperparameters and use Gradient Boosting in your machine learning projects."
